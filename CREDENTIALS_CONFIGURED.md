### Option 1: Test Locally (Recommended First)
1. Create a `.env` file in project root:
   ```env
   VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=service_l53wwur
   VITE_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=template_kbf2d6b
   VITE_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=aFMY4FzZzeI5jSpaj
   VITE_CONTACT_EMAIL=contact@Host-IT.app
   ```

2. Start dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Navigate to the contact section
4. Fill out and submit the form
5. Check `contact@Host-IT.app` for the email!

### Option 2: Deploy to Production
1. Go to your **Netlify Dashboard**
2. Navigate to: **Site Settings → Build & Deploy → Environment Variables**
3. Add these 4 variables:
   ```
   VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID = service_l53wwur
   VITE_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID = template_kbf2d6b
   VITE_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY = aFMY4FzZzeI5jSpaj
   VITE_CONTACT_EMAIL = contact@Host-IT.app
   ```

4. **Redeploy your site**
5. Test the contact form on your live site
6. Check `contact@Host-IT.app` for emails!

## ⚠️ Important: Environment Variables

### For Production (RECOMMENDED):
**Always use environment variables on Netlify** for:
- ✅ Better security
- ✅ Easy credential rotation
- ✅ No need to redeploy when changing keys

### Fallback in Code:
The credentials are also hardcoded as fallbacks in `src/services/emailService.ts`, so the form will work even without environment variables. However, using environment variables is more secure.

## ✅ Ready to Test!

Your contact form is now fully configured and ready to send emails to **contact@Host-IT.app**.

### Test Checklist:
- [ ] Test form submission locally
- [ ] Verify email arrives at contact@Host-IT.app
- [ ] Check that reply-to address is the customer's email
- [ ] Test on mobile device
- [ ] Test form validation (required fields)
- [ ] Deploy to Netlify
- [ ] Add environment variables to Netlify
- [ ] Test on production site
- [ ] Check spam folder if email doesn't arrive

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Test the form** (locally or on production)
2. **Set up email forwarding** (optional) - Forward contact@Host-IT.app to your personal email
3. **Monitor EmailJS dashboard** at https://dashboard.emailjs.com/
4. **Track your usage** - You get 200 free emails/month
